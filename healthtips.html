           <div class="topic"> 27 Health and Nutrition Tips That Are Actually Evidence-Based</div>
           <br>
           <div class="content">
            It’s easy to get confused when it comes to health and nutrition. Even qualified experts often seem to hold opposing opinions, which can make it difficult to figure out what you should actually be doing to optimize your health.
            <br>
            Yet, despite all the disagreements, a number of wellness tips are well supported by research.
            <br>
            Here are 27 health and nutrition tips that are based on scientific evidence.
            <br>
          
          <h3>  1. Limit sugary drinks</h3>
            Sugary drinks like sodas, fruit juices, and sweetened teas are the primary source of added sugar in the American diet (1Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Unfortunately, findings from several studies point to sugar-sweetened beverages increasing risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, even in people who are not carrying excess body fat (2Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Sugar-sweetened beverages are also uniquely harmful for children, as they can contribute not only to obesity in children but also to conditions that usually do not develop until adulthood, like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Healthier alternatives include:
            
            <li>water</li> 
            <li>unsweetened teas</li> 
            <li>sparkling water</li> 
           <li>coffee</li> 
        
            <h3>2. Eat nuts and seeds</h3>
            Some people avoid nuts because they are high in fat. However, nuts and seeds are incredibly nutritious. They are packed with protein, fiber, and a variety of vitamins and minerals (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Nuts may help you lose weight and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease (8Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Additionally, one large observational study noted that a low intake of nuts and seeds was potentially linked to an increased risk of death from heart disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes (9Trusted Source).
            <br>
            
           <h3>3. Avoid ultra-processed foods</h3>
            Ultra-processed foods are foods containing ingredients that are significantly modified from their original form. They often contain additives like added sugar, highly refined oil, salt, preservatives, artificial sweeteners, colors, and flavors as well (10Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Examples include:
            
            <li> snack cakes</li>
            <li> fast food</li>
            <li> frozen meals</li>
            <li>canned foods</li>
            <li> chips</li>
            Ultra-processed foods are highly palatable, meaning they are easily overeaten, and activate reward-related regions in the brain, which can lead to excess calorie consumption and weight gain. Studies show that diets high in ultra-processed food can contribute to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).
            <br>
            In addition to low quality ingredients like inflammatory fats, added sugar, and refined grains, they’re usually low in fiber, protein, and micronutrients. Thus, they provide mostly empty calories.
            <br>
           <h3>4. Don’t fear coffee</h3> 
            Despite some controversy over it, coffee is loaded with health benefits.
            <br>
            It’s rich in antioxidants, and some studies have linked coffee intake to longevity and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and numerous other illnesses (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).
            <br>
            The most beneficial intake amount appears to be 3–4 cups per day, although pregnant people should limit or avoid it completely because it has been linked to low birth weight (18Trusted Source).
            <br>
            However, it’s best to consume coffee and any caffeine-based items in moderation. Excessive caffeine intake may lead to health issues like insomnia and heart palpitations. To enjoy coffee in a safe and healthy way, keep your intake to less than 4 cups per day and avoid high-calorie, high-sugar additives like sweetened creamer.
            <br>
            <h3>5. Eat fatty fish</h3> 
            Fish is a great source of high-quality protein and healthy fat. This is particularly true of fatty fish, such as salmon, which is loaded with anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids and various other nutrients (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Studies show that people who eat fish regularly have a lower risk for several conditions, including heart disease, dementia, and inflammatory bowel disease (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).
            <br>
            
            <h3>6. Get enough sleep</h3>
            The importance of getting enough quality sleep cannot be overstated.
            <br>
            Poor sleep can drive insulin resistance, can disrupt your appetite hormones, and reduce your physical and mental performance (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).
            <br>
            What’s more, poor sleep is one of the strongest individual risk factors for weight gain and obesity. People who do not get enough sleep tend to make food choices that are higher in fat, sugar, and calories, potentially leading to unwanted weight gain (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).
            <br>
           <h3>7. Feed your gut bacteria</h3> 
            The bacteria in your gut, collectively called the gut microbiota, are incredibly important for overall health.
            <br>
            A disruption in gut bacteria is linked to some chronic diseases, including obesity and a myriad of digestive problems (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Good ways to improve gut health include eating probiotic foods like yogurt and sauerkraut, taking probiotic supplements — when indicated — and eating plenty of fiber. Notably, fiber serves as a prebiotic, or a food source for your gut bacteria (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).
            <br>
            
           <h3>8. Stay hydrated</h3> 
            Hydration is an important and often overlooked marker of health. Staying hydrated helps ensure that your body is functioning optimally and that your blood volume is sufficient (34Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Drinking water is the best way to stay hydrated, as it’s free of calories, sugar, and additives.
            <br>
            Although there’s no set amount that everyone needs per day, aim to drink enough so that your thirst is adequately quenched (35Trusted Source).
            <br>
           <h3> 9. Don’t eat heavily charred meats</h3>
            Meat can be a nutritious and healthy part of your diet. It’s very high in protein and a rich source of nutrients (36Trusted Source).
            <br>
            However, problems occur when meat is charred or burnt. This charring can lead to the formation of harmful compounds that may increase your risk for certain cancers (37Trusted Source).
            <br>
            When you cook meat, try not to char or burn it. Additionally limit your consumption of red and processed meats like lunch meats and bacon as these are linked to overall cancer risk and colon cancer risk (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source).
            <br>
           <h3> 10. Avoid bright lights before sleep</h3>
            When you’re exposed to bright lights — which contain blue light wavelengths — in the evening, it may disrupt your production of the sleep hormone melatonin (42Trusted Source).
            <br>
            Some ways to help reduce your blue light exposure is to wear blue light blocking glasses — especially if you use a computer or other digital screen for long periods of time — and to avoid digital screens for 30 minutes to an hour before going to bed (43Trusted Source).
            <br>

            This can help your body better produce melatonin naturally as evening progresses, helping you sleep better.
            
           <h3> 11. Take vitamin D if you’re deficient</h3>
            Most people do not get enough vitamin D. While these widespread vitamin D inadequacies are not imminently harmful, maintaining adequate vitamin D levels can help to optimize your health by improving bone strength, reducing symptoms of depression, strengthening your immune system, and lowering your risk for cancer (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source).
            <br>
            If you do not spend a lot of time in the sunlight, your vitamin D levels may be low.
            <br>
            If you have access, it’s a great idea to have your levels tested, so that you can correct your levels through vitamin D supplementation if necessary.
            
           
           <h3>12. Meditate</h3>  
            Stress has a negative effect on your health. It can affect your blood sugar levels, food choices, susceptibility to sickness, weight, fat distribution, and more. For this reason, it’s important to find healthy ways to manage your stress.
            
            Meditation is one such way, and it has some scientific evidence to support its use for stress management and improving health.
            
            In one study involving 48 people with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or both, researchers found that meditation helped lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and inflammation compared with the control group. Additionally, the participants in the meditation group reported improved mental and physical wellness.
            
            <h2>The bottom line</h2>
            A few simple steps can go a long way toward improving your eating patterns and wellness.
            <br>
            Still, if you’re trying to live a healthier life, do not just focus on the foods you eat. Exercise, sleep, and social relationships are also important.
            <br>
            With the evidence-based tips above, it’s easy to introduce small changes that can have a big impact on your overall health.
